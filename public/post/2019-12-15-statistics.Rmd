STATS is so fun! I never thought I would learn so much.We started using python.

my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"
my_dict = {1: 'ATC', 2: 'TCA', 3:'CAT', 4:'ATG'}
print(my_dict)
def count_kmers(seq,k):
 count = {}
 num= len(seq)-k+1
 for i in range(num):
 kmer=seq[i:i+k]
 if kmer not in count:
 count[kmer] +=1
 return count

count_kmers("CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT")
count_kmers("ATCATCATG")

This code helps is find sequences.
